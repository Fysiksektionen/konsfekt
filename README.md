## Develop
Dependencies:
- rust
- npm


### Setup
Get Google OAuth client credentials from [Google](https://console.developers.google.com/). You will need a client id and a client secret.
Make sure to add `http://127.0.0.1:8080` as an Authorized JavaScript origin and `http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/google/callback`
as an Authorized redirect URI.

> Due to a limited set of authorized origins Google allows, simple developing is limited to `localhost` 
unless using a tunneling service.

Create a `.env` file with the following fields
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

### Frontend
If you want a live preview when developing the frontend you need to run it separately from the backend. To do this
set the `STATIC_FRONTEND` environment variable to `false`.

If a static frontend should be used it will have to be compiled with the following command inside the `frontend` directory:

```npm run build```

### Running
Backend can be run using:

```cargo run```

For separate frontend, run

```npm run dev```

from within the `frontend` directory

## Docker
Dependencies:
- docker (docker compose)

Run the container with `docker compose up --build` (`--build` flag only needed the first time)

## About

### Backend
This project uses a Rust backend built with [Actix Web](https://actix.rs).

### Frontend
The frontend is served as a static site generated by [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev).

### Auth
Session handling is done using principles from [lucia-auth](https://lucia-auth.com) with login done through Google.
