## Develop
Dependencies:
- rust
- npm

### Setup
Get Google OAuth client credentials from [Google](https://console.developers.google.com/). You will need a client id and a client secret.

Create a `.env` file with the following fields
- `SITE_DOMAIN` - localhost/LAN ip
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

Make sure to add the needed authorized URIs to your Google OAuth client. Authorized JavaScript origin should be set to the `SITE_DOMAIN`
and the Authorized redirect URI should be the same but with `/auth/google/callback` appended.

### Build
Build frontend using `npm run build` inside the `frontend` directory.

Build and run web server with `cargo run`.

## Docker
Dependencies:
- docker (docker compose)

Follow the steps found in the [dev setup](#setup) to get started.

Run the container with `docker compose up --build`. (--build flag only needed the first time)
